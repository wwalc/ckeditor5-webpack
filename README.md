### About This Project

This is not an official documentation. It is a mere mix of webpack configuration used by [ckeditor5.github.io](https://github.com/CKEditor5/ckeditor5.github.io) with 
code posted by Ilya Semenov in [this comment](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/139#issuecomment-276876222), which I'm currently using for playing with CKEditor 5.
